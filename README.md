                                                   Car Insurance Data Analysis

Data Overview ::
    The data gives the details of third party motor insurance claims in Sweden for the year 1977. In Sweden, all motor insurance companies apply identical risk arguments to classify customers, and thus their portfolios and their claims statistics can be combined. The data were compiled by a Swedish Committee on the Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance. The Committee was asked to look into the problem of analyzing the real influence on the claims of the risk arguments and to compare this structure with the actual tariff.
    
Dataset Variables ::

Kilometres - Kilometres travelled per year 
1: < 1000 \n 
2: 1000-15000 
3: 15000-20000 
4: 20000-25000 
5: > 25000 
 
Zone - Geographical zones 
1: Stockholm, Göteborg, and Malmö with surroundings 
2: Other large cities with surroundings 
3: Smaller cities with surroundings in southern Sweden 
4: Rural areas in southern Sweden 
5: Smaller cities with surroundings in northern Sweden 
6: Rural areas in northern Sweden 
7: Gotland

Bonus - No claims bonus; equal to the number of years, plus one, since the last claim
Make - 1-8 represents eight different common car models. All other models are combined in class 9. 
Insured - Number of insured in policy-years. 
Claims - Number of claims.    
Payment - Total value of payments in Swedish Krona.



Objective-1 :: The committee is interested to know each field of the data collected through descriptive analysis to gain basic insights 
               into the data set and to prepare for further analysis.

Objective-2 :: The total value of payment by an insurance company is an important factor to be monitored. So the committee has 
               decided to find whether this payment is related to number of claims and the number of insured policy years. 
               They also want to visualize the results for better understanding.  

Code & Output::

cor(DS$Claims,DS$Payment)
> cor(DS$Claims,DS$Payment)

	Value is highly significant

Objective-3 :: The committee wants to figure out the reasons for insurance payment increase and decrease. So they have decided to find 
               whether distance, location, bonus, make, and insured amount or claims are affecting the payment or all or some of these 
               are affecting it.

	This shows that except Bonus and Make all other variables are significant and are influencing the payment.
	I used backward elimination method to build our final liner model.
      Payment ~ Claims + Insured + Zone + Kilometres


Objective-4 :: The insurance company is planning to establish a new branch office, so they are interested to find at what location, 
               kilometer, and bonus level their insured amount, claims, and payment get increased.

Findings – 

a)	Zone 4 has the highest value for Insured, Claims and Payments.
b)	Kilometre group 1 and 2 has the highest value for Insured, Claims and Payments.
c)	Bonus group 7 has the highest value for Insured, Claims and Payments.



Objective-5 :: The committee wants to understand what affects their claim rates so as to decide the right premiums for a certain set 
               of situations. Hence, they need to find whether the insured amount, zone, kilometer, bonus, or make affects the claim 
               rates and to what extent.

Model1 <- lm(Claims ~ Kilometres + Zone + Bonus + Make + Insured, data=DS)
